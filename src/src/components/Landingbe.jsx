            <p>A fun PowerPoint Karaoke event to challenge both the author of the slide and the presenter to improve their communication skills. Submit or Present a Slide (or Both!)</p><br/>
            <p>Create a PowerPoint slide with a contribution to your research or a materials science-related topic. Do not be too serious! Popular science topics are not the point; we are looking for the funniest story or best design! Topics can range from your actual research to something silly, such as the use of rubber ducks. Be sure to keep it simple so that anyone can present, and keep it cleanâ€”inappropriate content will not be accepted.</p><br/>
            <p>During the event, presenters will be assigned a random slide out of the pool of the submitted slides by the authors. Presenters will have five minutes to prepare a two-minute (maximum) presentation. Winners will be selected by anonymous audience voting. Goodies will be awarded to the best three authors and presenters.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">QUIZ (Mega Hunt Game)</h3>
            <p>The quiz will involve some sort of gameplay where there will be different levels and each level will first begin with a storyline which will be conveyed to the participants through an audio-visual clip prepared by us followed by a series of situational-based questions. The decision whether you proceed to the next level will be determined by your performance in the former level. So basically, every story will have a situation of let us say a combat or a clash where winning or losing will ultimately depend upon their exposure to external factors like extreme temperature, acidic/basic environment, radiation etc. The winners will be judged on how accurately they chose, which will decide finally whether they survived all the levels or were eliminated in any particular level.</p>
