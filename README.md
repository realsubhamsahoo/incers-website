## 1. Introduction

The **Incers Club** is a vibrant community of passionate individuals dedicated to advancing knowledge, fostering collaboration, and promoting personal growth. Whether you’re a student, professional, or enthusiast, the club provides a platform for networking, learning, and innovation.

The **Indian Ceramic Society (InCerS)**, established in 1928 under the guidance of **Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya**, is a non-profit organization focused on advancing ceramic science, arts, and technology. Through scientific publications, events, and exhibitions, InCerS connects material enthusiasts, industrial professionals, and students.

**InCerS, NITR Chapter**, organizes events like **Mrittika**, a premier fest with a budget exceeding that of the institute’s annual tech fest. The club is currently presided over by **Shivam Sharma** (3rd-year B.Tech, Ceramic Engineering) and guided by **Prof. Shantanu Behera**, an alumnus and Associate Dean of Alumni Relations. The club operates under the **Technical Society of SAC** at NIT Rourkela.
